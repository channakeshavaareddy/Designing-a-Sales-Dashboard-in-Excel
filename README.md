# Designing a Sales Dashboard in Excel
## Project Description
In the present business environment, organizations rely heavily on data to evaluate performance and make effective decisions. Sales data, when analyzed properly, helps businesses understand customer behavior, product performance, and regional demand. This project focuses on the design and development of an interactive Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel for an E-Commerce organization.
The dashboard is designed to analyze sales performance across different product categories and enables users to view trends on a monthly, product-wise, and region-wise basis. The project makes use of an E-Commerce dataset that contains detailed information related to orders, customers, products, shipping, sales, and profit. Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, Charts, User Controls, and formulas are used to transform raw data into meaningful insights. The final dashboard provides a consolidated view of key performance indicators (KPIs) on a single screen, making sales analysis easier and more efficient.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
-	To analyze sales performance across different product categories
-	To allow users to select a product category and view corresponding sales and profit trends
-	To study month-wise and product-wise sales performance
-	To analyze sales distribution across various regions
-	To visualize shipping days using histogram analysis
-	To design a simple, interactive, and user-friendly sales dashboard in Excel.

## Problem Statement
An E-Commerce company requires an effective way to analyze its sales data and monitor performance across different product categories. The company wants to provide users with control to select a product category and view sales trends on a month-by-month and product-by-product basis. To address this requirement, Microsoft Excel is used as the analytical tool to design an interactive sales dashboard that presents sales, profit, quantity, and shipping-related insights in a clear and structured manner.

Prerequisites
The following skills are required to complete this project successfully:
-	Ability to create charts and graphs in Microsoft Excel
-	Knowledge of data analysis techniques in Excel
-	Skills in formatting and organizing data for better presentation
-	Experience working with Pivot Tables and Excel formulas
-	Basic understanding of Excel user controls such as Combo Boxes

# Methodology
The project was carried out using the following steps:
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Raw data was reviewed and organized into a structured tabular format. Data consistency and accuracy were ensured before analysis.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Histograms were created to analyze shipping days, and month-wise and region-wise sales and profit tables were prepared for trend analysis.
## Pivot Table Creation
- Pivot Tables were developed to summarize sales and profit data dynamically. These tables served as the foundation for charts and dashboard elements.
## User Control Implementation
- A Combo Box was created to allow users to select product categories. Excel formulas such as OFFSET and SUMIFS were used to update values dynamically based on user selection.
## Visualization
- Column charts and summary tables were created to display monthly sales, regional performance, and key metrics such as total sales, profit, quantity, and number of orders.
##  Dashboard Design
- All charts, KPIs, and tables were integrated into a single dashboard layout. Proper formatting and alignment were applied to improve clarity and ease of use.


## Tools and Technologies Used
-	Microsoft Excel
-	Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
-	Excel Formulas (SUMIFS, OFFSET)
-	User Controls (Combo Box)
-	Conditional Formatting

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of this project is a fully functional and interactive sales dashboard that:
-	Allows users to filter data by product category
-	Displays month-wise, product-wise, and region-wise sales trends
-	Provides quick insights into sales performance and profitability
-	Supports informed and data-driven business decisions
